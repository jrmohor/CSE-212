def find_pairs(words):
    """
    The words parameter contains a list of two character 
    words (lower case, no duplicates). Using sets, find an O(n) 
    solution for displaying all symmetric pairs of words.  

    For example, if words was: [am, at, ma, if, fi], we would display:

    am & ma
    if & fi

    The order of the display above does not matter.  'at' would not 
    be displayed because 'ta' is not in the list of words.

    As a special case, if the letters are the same (example: 'aa') then
    it would not match anything else (remember no the assumption above
    that there were no duplicates) and therefore should not be displayed.
